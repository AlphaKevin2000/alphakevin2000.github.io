Which data is collected and how is it processed?</strong>\n\nThe CovApp is used to ask questions about current symptoms, your last trips and possible contacts. These data are not attributed by name.\n\nThe CovApp is a web application. The following data is automatically transferred to the Charité's web server, which is operated by D4L data4life gGmbH as a processor on behalf of the Charité, with a computer center in Frankfurt at the subcontractor Amazon Web Services (AWS):\n\n- IP address of the device used for the retrieval\n- Web address (URL) of the page from which the file was requested (referrer)\n- Date and time of the request\n- Data volume transferred\n- Description of the type of web browser used\n\nThe above-mentioned data is not stored after the app has been used, so that no conclusion can be drawn as to the identity of the user.\n\nThe answers to the questions answered in the app and the recommendations for action are stored exclusively locally on the terminal device you use (smartphone, tablet, or PC). This data will – if you wish – be summarized in a QR code. You can show this QR code when being tested for COVID-19, at a doctor's or hospital to facilitate the collection of the necessary anamnesis data.\n\nYou can delete the data stored by CovApp on your terminal device at any time by clicking \"Delete answers\" at the end of the questionnaire. \n\n<strong>3. For what purposes and on what legal basis are the data processed?</strong>\n\nThe CovApp is intended to make it easier for users to assess for themselves whether there is a need for further clarification regarding a COVID-19 infection and offers concrete recommendations for action. The app thus serves to combat the current COVID-19 pandemic. The legal basis of the processing is Article 6.1. lit. d) and e), Art. 9. 2 c), h), i) of the General Data Protection Regulation in conjunction with § 14.1.3 of the Berlin Data Protection Act.\n\nIn all other respects, the Charité's data protection declaration applies, available at <a href=\"https://www.charite.de/service/datenschutz/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.charite.de/service/datenschutz/</a>",

    "faq_content": "<strong>About the coronavirus</strong>\nThe scientific term for the novel coronavirus is „SARS-CoV-2“. This virus can cause a respiratory disease. The name of this disease is called „COVID-19“. Because the infectious disease COVID-19 has already spread across countries and continents, it's referred to as a pandemic.\n\n<strong>Transmission</strong>\nThe new coronavirus is transmitted via droplet infection. It can directly be transferred between humans, when droplets containing the virus get into the respiratory system after they are absorbed via the lining of the mouth and nose or via the conjunctiva of the eye. But an indirect infection is also possible, when droplets are transmitted via the hands to the mucosa of mouth, nose and eyes. Symptoms occur 5 to 6, at most 14 days, after infection. \n\n<strong>Symptoms</strong>\nAfter an infection with the coronavirus, the disease runs a mild course and is not life-threatening for most people. This extends to pregnant women and children. There can be flu-like symptoms, such as a dry cough, fatigue and fever. Furthermore, some patients suffer from a sore throat, headaches, limb pain and chills. Currently it’s been assumed that 4 in 5 cases run a mild course. Though in some patients the infection can have a serious course, causing respiratory distress and bilateral pneumonia. This mostly affects elderly persons or people with chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, chronic lung disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or cancer. Those severe cases have to be treated in intensive care in a hospital.\n\n<strong>Solidarity</strong>\nAlthough there is a very good healthcare system available in Germany, it is not prepared for a rapid increase in intensive care patients. But if it is possible to prolong an increase in severe cases, treatment of infected patients will continue to be available. This can only be done if every citizen practices social distancing. As a precautionary measure, especially for the elderly generation and the chronically ill, everyone should take the situation seriously and avoid social contact as much as possible. But please, provide for elderly and chronically ill relatives or neighbors and living alone or persons in need with food and daily life essentials. Be considerate and attentive for their needs and worries. Communicate with each other – but stay at least 1.5 meters apart. Act in solidarity.\n\n<strong>Protection</strong>\nTo slow down the spreading of the virus, avoid direct contact, for example when meeting someone. Wash your hands regularly and thoroughly, at least 20 seconds with soap and water. Keep as much distance as possible when coughing or sneezing – turn away from other people. Sneeze into a sleeve or a tissue, which you throw into a bin immediately. Don’t share something you touched with your mouth, like a glass or a bottle, with someone else. Stay at home.\n\n<strong>Therapy</strong>\nThe therapy of the infection depends on the severity of the disease. Mild cases don’t have to be treated and can get well at home. Severe pneumonia has to be treated, for example with oxygen treatment, fluid substitution or antibiotics to treat bacterial co-infections. This mostly has to be done in a hospital.\n\n<strong>Vaccination</strong>\nResearchers are currently working on developing a vaccine. Right now, there is no vaccination available which protects against the new coronavirus.\n\n<strong>Get help</strong>\nViolence against women support Hotline: <a href=\"tel:+4980000116016\">08000 116 016</a>\nCrisis Hotline: <a href=\"tel:+498001110111\">0800 111 0 111</a> or <a href=\"tel:+498001110222\">0800 111 0 222</a>\n\n<strong>Stay informed</strong>\nThe <a href=\"https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/coronavirus.html\" target=\"_blank\">German Ministry of Health</a> regularly updates the information on the coronavirus.\n\nCharité researcher Prof. Dr. Christian Drosten keeps you up-to-date on the <a href=\"https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/info/Corona-Podcast-Alle-Folgen-in-der-Uebersicht,podcastcoronavirus134.html\" target=\"_blank\">NDR podcast</a>",

The app asks you several questions including symptoms and potential contacts. Besides recommendations for action, relevant contacts, and structured results, the purpose of the app is to guide you safely through the various health care offers and, if necessary, to show you the way to hospitals or to examination centers. Please note that this app does not provide diagnostic services.</p> \n<p>In this way, the CovApp can help you to better assess your medical condition, provide recommendations regarding doctor’s visits or coronavirus testing, and summarize relevant medical information for future doctor’s consultation. </p><p><h3 class=\"o-headline-3\">How can I use the CovApp? </h3></p>\n<p><strong>1. Start the survey by clicking \"Start questionnaire\"</strong></p><p>The survey contains questions regarding your current symptoms and contact history.  \nCompleting the survey takes approximately 5 minutes. Please try to answer the questions as precisely as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Survey and recommendations</strong></p><p>At the end of the survey, the CovApp summarizes your answers and provides you with a recommendation for action, for example: <ul><li>Advice to contact the public hotline for coronavirus</li><li>Advice to contact your general practitioner</li><li>Advice on social distancing</li></ul></p>\n<p><strong>3. Preparation for doctor’s visit</strong></p><p>When you're given the advice for a doctor’s visit or a visit to one of the coronavirus testing sites, please bring the QR code or print the summary presented. Some coronavirus testing sites (like the Charité) can scan the code so that your answers are made directly available to our medical staff and can be used for your consultation. This helps to speed up the process of the medical interview. \nIf visiting your local physician or any other coronavirus testing site, please print the summary provided and bring it along to your consultation.</p>",
