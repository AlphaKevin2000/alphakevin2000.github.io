Dieses Virus kann eine Atemwegserkrankung ausl\xf6sen. Diese Erkrankung tr\xe4gt den Namen \u201eCOVID-19\u201c. Weil sich die Infektionskrankheit COVID-19 bereits \xfcber L\xe4nder und Kontinente hinweg ausgebreitet hat, spricht man von einer Pandemie.\\n \\n<strong>Die \xdcbertragung</strong>\\nDas neuartige Coronavirus wird \xfcber die sogenannte Tr\xf6pfcheninfektion \xfcbertragen. Dies kann direkt von Mensch zu Mensch geschehen, wenn virushaltige Tr\xf6pfchen \xfcber die Mund- oder Nasenschleimhaut oder die Augenbindehaut in die Atemwege gelangen. Aber auch eine indirekte Ansteckung ist m\xf6glich, wenn Tr\xf6pfchen \xfcber die H\xe4nde mit den Schleimh\xe4uten in Kontakt kommen. Krankheitszeichen treten im Durchschnitt nach 5 bis 6, maximal 14 Tagen nach einer Ansteckung auf.\\n \\n<strong>Die Krankheitszeichen</strong>\\nWenn es zu einer Infektion mit dem Coronavirus gekommen ist, verl\xe4uft diese f\xfcr die die meisten Menschen leicht und ist nicht lebensbedrohlich. Das gilt auch f\xfcr Schwangere und Kinder. Leichte Krankheitszeichen k\xf6nnen grippe\xe4hnliche Symptome wie trockener Husten, Abgeschlagenheit und Fieber sein. Dar\xfcber hinaus leiden einige Patientinnen und Patienten unter Halskratzen, Kopf- und Gliederschmerzen und Sch\xfcttelfrost. Derzeit geht man davon aus, dass 4 von 5 Infektionen mild verlaufen. Bei einigen Betroffenen kann das Virus jedoch zu einem schwereren Verlauf mit Atemproblemen bis hin zur beidseitigen Lungenentz\xfcndung f\xfchren. Hier handelt es sich oftmals um \xe4ltere Menschen und Patientinnen und Patienten mit Vorerkrankungen wie Herz-Kreislauf-Erkrankungen, chronischen Atemwegserkrankungen, Diabetes, Bluthochdruck oder Krebs. Diese schweren F\xe4lle m\xfcssen intensivmedizinisch im Krankenhaus behandelt werden.\\n\\n<strong>Solidarit\xe4t</strong>\\nObwohl Deutschland \xfcber ein sehr gutes Gesundheitssystem verf\xfcgt, ist dieses nicht auf einen steilen Anstieg insbesondere der intensiv medizinisch zu betreuenden Patientinnen und Patienten eingestellt. Gelingt es aber, den Anstieg schwerer Erkrankungen \xfcber einen l\xe4ngeren Zeitraum hinauszuz\xf6gern, werden Infizierte auch weiterhin gut versorgt werden k\xf6nnen. Darum liegt das Hauptaugenmerk derzeit auf einer Entschleunigung der Infektionsrate. Dies kann nur gelingen, wenn alle B\xfcrgerinnen und B\xfcrger auf r\xe4umliche Distanz gehen. Zum Schutz, insbesondere der \xe4lteren Generation und chronisch Kranker, sollten alle darum die Situation ernst nehmen und soziale Kontakte so weit wie m\xf6glich einschr\xe4nken. Versorgen Sie aber bitte \xe4ltere, hochbetagte oder chronisch kranke Angeh\xf6rige oder Nachbarn und alleinstehende, hilfsbed\xfcrftige Menschen mit Lebensmitteln und Dingen des t\xe4glichen Bedarfs. Haben Sie ein offenes Ohr f\xfcr ihre Sorgen und kommunizieren Sie miteinander \u2013 aber halten Sie dabei bitte mindestens 1,5 Meter Abstand. Handeln Sie solidarisch.\\n\\n<strong>Schutz</strong>\\nUm die Verbreitung des Coronavirus zu entschleunigen, vermeiden Sie unbedingt Ber\xfchrungen beispielsweise bei der Begr\xfc\xdfung und waschen Sie Ihre H\xe4nde regelm\xe4\xdfig und gr\xfcndlich mindestens 20 Sekunden lang mit Wasser und Seife. Halten Sie beim Husten oder Niesen gr\xf6\xdftm\xf6glichen Abstand \u2013 drehen Sie sich einfach von ihrem Gegen\xfcber weg. Niesen Sie in die Armbeuge oder in ein Papiertaschentuch, das Sie danach immer entsorgen. Vermeiden Sie es, mit ihren H\xe4nden Mund, Augen oder Nase zu ber\xfchren. Teilen Sie Gegenst\xe4nde, die Sie mit Ihrem Mund ber\xfchren, wie z.B. Tassen oder Flaschen, nicht mit anderen Personen. Bleiben Sie daheim.\\n \\n<strong>Therapie</strong>\\nDie Behandlung der Infektion richtet sich nach der Schwere des Krankheitsbildes. Milde F\xe4lle m\xfcssen nicht behandelt und k\xf6nnen daheim auskuriert werden. Schwerere Lungenentz\xfcndungen werden z.B. durch die Gabe von Sauerstoff, den Ausgleich des Fl\xfcssigkeitshaushalts oder Antibiotikagabe zur Behandlung von bakteriellen Begleitinfektionen behandelt. Dies geschieht meistens im Krankenhaus.\\n \\n<strong>Impfung</strong>\\nEs wird an der Entwicklung eines Impfstoffes gearbeitet. Momentan steht jedoch noch kein Impfstoff zur Verf\xfcgung, der vor dem neuartigen Coronavirus sch\xfctzt.\\n\\n<strong>Suchen Sie sich Hilfe</strong>\\n Hilfetelefon \\"Gewalt gegen Frauen\\": <a href=\\"tel:+4980000116016\\">08000 116 016</a>\\n Telefonseelsorge: <a href=\\"tel:+498001110111\\">0800 111 0 111</a> oder <a href=\\"tel:+498001110222\\">0800 111 0 222</a>\\n Elterntelefon: <a href=\\"tel:+498001110550\\">0800 111 0 550</a>\\n \\"Nummer gegen Kummer\\" f\xfcr Kinder und Jugendliche: <a href=\\"tel:+49116111\\">116 111</a>\\n \\n<strong>Bleiben Sie informiert</strong>\\nDas <a href=\\"https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/coronavirus.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Bundesministerium f\xfcr Gesundheit</a> aktualisiert regelm\xe4\xdfig die Information zum Coronavirus.\\n\\nDer Charit\xe9-Wissenschaftler Prof. Dr. Christian Drosten h\xe4lt sie im <a href=\\"https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/info/Corona-Podcast-Alle-Folgen-in-der-Uebersicht,podcastcoronavirus134.html\\" tarrget=\\"_blank\\">NDR-Podcast</a> auf dem Laufenden.","faq_headline":"FAQ Coronavirus","found_code":"Es wurde ein QR-Code gefunden","imprint_content":"<strong>Anbieter</strong>\\nCharit\xe9 \u2013 Universit\xe4tsmedizin Berlin\\nZentrale Postanschrift: Charit\xe9platz 1, 10117 Berlin\\nDie Charit\xe9 \u2013 Universit\xe4tsmedizin Berlin ist eine K\xf6rperschaft des \xd6ffentlichen Rechts.

Personal data is not stored and no conclusions regarding the identity of the user can be made.","disclaimer_sub_headline_1":"Remarks regarding usage of cookies","faq_content":"<strong>About the coronavirus</strong>\\nThe scientific term for the novel coronavirus is \u201eSARS-CoV-2\u201c. This virus can cause a respiratory disease. The name of this disease is called \u201eCOVID-19\u201c. Because the infectious disease COVID-19 has already spread across countries and continents, it\'s referred to as a pandemic.\\n\\n<strong>Transmission</strong>\\nThe new coronavirus is transmitted via droplet infection. It can directly be transferred between humans, when droplets containing the virus get into the respiratory system after they are absorbed via the lining of the mouth and nose or via the conjunctiva of the eye. But an indirect infection is also possible, when droplets are transmitted via the hands to the mucosa of mouth, nose and eyes. Symptoms occur 5 to 6, at most 14 days, after infection.\\u2028\\n\\n<strong>Symptoms</strong>\\nAfter an infection with the coronavirus, the disease runs a mild course and is not life-threatening for most people. This extends to pregnant women and children. There can be flu-like symptoms, such as a dry cough, fatigue and fever. Furthermore, some patients suffer from a sore throat, headaches, limb pain and chills. Currently it\u2019s been assumed that 4 in 5 cases run a mild course. Though in some patients the infection can have a serious course, causing respiratory distress and bilateral pneumonia. This mostly affects elderly persons or people with chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, chronic lung disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or cancer. Those severe cases have to be treated in intensive care in a hospital.\\n\\n<strong>Solidarity</strong>\\nAlthough there is a very good healthcare system available in Germany, it is not prepared for a rapid increase in intensive care patients. But if it is possible to prolong an increase in severe cases, treatment of infected patients will continue to be available. This can only be done if every citizen practices social distancing. As a precautionary measure, especially for the elderly generation and the chronically ill, everyone should take the situation seriously and avoid social contact as much as possible. But please, provide for elderly and chronically ill relatives or neighbors and living alone or persons in need with food and daily life essentials. Be considerate and attentive for their needs and worries. Communicate with each other \u2013 but stay at least 1.5 meters apart. Act in solidarity.\\n\\n<strong>Protection</strong>\\nTo slow down the spreading of the virus, avoid direct contact, for example when meeting someone. Wash your hands regularly and thoroughly, at least 20 seconds with soap and water. Keep as much distance as possible when coughing or sneezing \u2013 turn away from other people. Sneeze into a sleeve or a tissue, which you throw into a bin immediately. Don\u2019t share something you touched with your mouth, like a glass or a bottle, with someone else. Stay at home.\\n\\n<strong>Therapy</strong>\\nThe therapy of the infection depends on the severity of the disease. Mild cases don\u2019t have to be treated and can get well at home. Severe pneumonia has to be treated, for example with oxygen treatment, fluid substitution or antibiotics to treat bacterial co-infections. This mostly has to be done in a hospital.\\n\\n<strong>Vaccination</strong>\\nResearchers are currently working on developing a vaccine. Right now, there is no vaccination available which protects against the new coronavirus.\\n\\n<strong>Get help</strong>\\nViolence against women support Hotline: <a href=\\"tel:+4980000116016\\">08000 116 016</a>\\nCrisis Hotline: <a href=\\"tel:+498001110111\\">0800 111 0 111</a> or <a href=\\"tel:+498001110222\\">0800 111 0 222</a>\\n\\n<strong>Stay informed</strong>\\nThe <a href=\\"https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/coronavirus.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">German Ministry of Health</a> regularly updates the information on the coronavirus.\\n\\nCharit\xe9 researcher Prof. Dr. Christian Drosten keeps you up-to-date on the <a href=\\"https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/info/Corona-Podcast-Alle-Folgen-in-der-Uebersicht,podcastcoronavirus134.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">NDR podcast</a>","faq_headline":"FAQ Coronavirus","found_code":"A QR code was found","imprint_content":"<strong>Provider </strong>\\nCharit\xe9 \u2013 Universit\xe4tsmedizin Berlin\\nPostal address: Charit\xe9platz 1, 10117 Berlin \\nDie Charit\xe9 \u2013 Universit\xe4tsmedizin Berlin is a public-law institution.
